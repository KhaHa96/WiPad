# WiPad

Wireless Padlock or WiPad is an attempt at creating a smart padlock that grants access to the premises of a critical facility to authorized users exclusively.

A user has to go through a seamless registration procedure once for them to be recognized in future access attempts. Once a user is registered, their smart lock interaction history will continue to be tracked for the lifetime of the padlock or until a user with administrative rights manually removes them from the registered users' database.

WiPad runs on an nRF52832 SoC and can only be communicated with wirelessly via BLE.
